class Solution:
  def checkIfPangram(self, sentence):
    set1 = set()
    for char in sentence.lower():
      if char.isalpha():
        set1.add(char)
    if len(set1) == 26:
      return True
    return False

Time complexity O(N) as it only iterates over each element once
Space complexity is O(1) as there is a static limit of 26 (does not scale)
